.SH NAME
std::basic_string::shrink_to_fit \- std::basic_string::shrink_to_fit

.SH Synopsis
   void shrink_to_fit();            \fI(since C++11)\fP
                                    \fI(until C++20)\fP
   constexpr void shrink_to_fit();  \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Requests the removal of unused capacity.

   It is a non-binding request to reduce capacity() to size(). It depends on the
   implementation if the request is fulfilled.

   If (and only if) reallocation takes place, all pointers, references, and iterators
   are invalidated.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Complexity

   (unspecified)                    \fI(until C++17)\fP
   Linear in the size of the string \fI(since C++17)\fP

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <string>

 int main()
 {
     std::string s;
     std::cout << "Size of std::string is " << sizeof s << " bytes\\n"
         << "Default-constructed capacity is " << s.capacity()
         << " and size is " << s.size() << '\\n';
     for (int i=0; i<42; i++)
         s.append(" 42 ");
     std::cout << "Capacity after 42 appends is " << s.capacity()
         << " and size is " << s.size() << '\\n';
     s.clear();
     std::cout << "Capacity after clear() is " << s.capacity()
         << " and size is " << s.size() << '\\n';
     s.shrink_to_fit();
     std::cout << "Capacity after shrink_to_fit() is " << s.capacity()
         << " and size is " << s.size() << '\\n';
 }

.SH Possible output:

 GCC output:
 Size of std::string is 32 bytes
 Default-constructed capacity is 15 and size 0
 Capacity after 42 appends is 240 and size 168
 Capacity after clear() is 240 and size 0
 Capacity after shrink_to_fit() is 15 and size 0

 clang output (with -stdlib=libc++):
 Size of std::string is 24 bytes
 Default-constructed capacity is 22 and size is 0
 Capacity after 42 appends is 191 and size is 168
 Capacity after clear() is 191 and size is 0
 Capacity after shrink_to_fit() is 22 and size is 0
