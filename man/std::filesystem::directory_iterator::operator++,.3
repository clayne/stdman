.SH Synopsis

   directory_iterator& operator++();                      \fI(since C++17)\fP

.SH Parameters

   ec - error code to store error status to

.SH Return value

   *this

.SH Exceptions

   The overload that does not take a std::error_code& parameter throws
   filesystem::filesystem_error on underlying OS API errors, constructed with the OS
   error code as the error code argument. The overload taking a std::error_code&
   parameter sets it to the OS API error code if an OS API call fails, and executes
   ec.clear() if no errors occur. Any overload not marked noexcept may throw
   std::bad_alloc if memory allocation fails.
