.SH NAME
std::ostream_iterator::ostream_iterator \- std::ostream_iterator::ostream_iterator

.SH Synopsis
   ostream_iterator( ostream_type& stream, const CharT* delim ); \fB(1)\fP
   ostream_iterator( ostream_type& stream );                     \fB(2)\fP

   1) Constructs the iterator with stream as the associated stream and delim as the
   delimiter.
   2) Constructs the iterator with stream as the associated stream and a null pointer
   as the delimiter.

.SH Parameters

   stream - the output stream to be accessed by this iterator
   delim  - the null-terminated character string to be inserted into the stream after
            each output

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <iterator>
 #include <algorithm>
 #include <numeric>
 int main()
 {
     std::ostream_iterator<char> oo {std::cout};
     std::ostream_iterator<int> i1 {std::cout, ", "};
     std::fill_n(i1, 5, -1);
     *oo++ = '\\n';

     std::ostream_iterator<double> i2 {std::cout, "; "};
     *i2++ = 3.14;
     *i2++ = 2.71;
     *oo++ = '\\n';

     std::common_iterator<std::counted_iterator<std::ostream_iterator<float>>,
                          std::default_sentinel_t>
         first { std::counted_iterator{std::ostream_iterator<float>{std::cout," ~ "}, 5} },
         last { std::default_sentinel };
     std::iota(first, last, 2.2);
     *oo++ = '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 -1, -1, -1, -1, -1,
 3.14; 2.71;
 2.2 ~ 3.2 ~ 4.2 ~ 5.2 ~ 6.2 ~
