.SH NAME
std::char_traits::copy \- std::char_traits::copy

.SH Synopsis
   static char_type* copy( char_type* dest, const char_type* src,         \fI(until C++20)\fP
   std::size_t count );
   static constexpr char_type* copy( char_type* dest, const char_type*    \fI(since C++20)\fP
   src, std::size_t count );

   Copies count characters from the character string pointed to by src to the character
   string pointed to by dest.

   Formally, for each i in [0, count), performs assign(src[i], dest[i]).

   The behavior is undefined if copied character ranges overlap, i.e. src is in [dest,
   dest + count).

.SH Parameters

   dest  - pointer to a character string to copy to
   src   - pointer to a character string to copy from
   count - the number of characters to copy

.SH Return value

   dest

.SH Exceptions

   Throws nothing.

.SH Complexity

   Linear.
