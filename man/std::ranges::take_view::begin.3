.SH NAME
std::ranges::take_view::begin \- std::ranges::take_view::begin

.SH Synopsis
   constexpr auto begin() requires (!__SimpleView<V>);           \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP
   constexpr auto begin() const requires ranges::range<const V>; \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Returns an iterator to the first element of the take_view.

   1) Returns a std::counted_iterator or a ranges::iterator_t<V>.
   2) Returns a std::counted_iterator or a ranges::iterator_t<const V>.

   Overload \fB(1)\fP does not participate in overload resolution if V is a simple view (that
   is, if V and const V are views with the same iterator and sentinel types).

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   The result depends on the concepts satisfied by possible const-qualified underlying
   view type Base_, which is V (for overload \fB(1)\fP) or const V (for overload \fB(2)\fP).

   Let base_ be the underlying view, count_ be the number passed to the constructor
   (0 if default initialized).

   The underlying                           random_access_range
   view satisfies
         ...               yes                                 no
                                        std::counted_iterator(ranges::begin(base_),
   sized_range yes ranges::begin(base_)
                                        ranges::range_difference_t<Base_>(this->size()))
               no  std::counted_iterator(ranges::begin(base_), count_)

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <ranges>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <string_view>
 using namespace std::literals;

 int main()
 {
     static constexpr auto sv = {"∀x"sv, "∃y"sv, "ε"sv, "δ"sv};

     std::cout << *std::ranges::take_view(sv, 8).begin() << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 ∀x
