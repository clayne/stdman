.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <memory>
   template< class T >        \fB(1)\fP
   struct allocator;
   template<>                 \fB(2)\fP (deprecated in C++17)
   struct allocator<void>;        (removed in C++20)

   The std::allocator class template is the default Allocator used by all standard
   library containers if no user-specified allocator is provided. The default allocator
   is stateless, that is, all instances of the given allocator are interchangeable,
   compare equal and can deallocate memory allocated by any other instance of the same
   allocator type.

   The explicit specialization for void lacks the member typedefs
   reference, const_reference, size_type and difference_type. This        \fI(until C++20)\fP
   specialization declares no member functions.

   The default allocator satisfies allocator completeness requirements. \fI(since C++17)\fP

   (removed in C++20)

.SH Notes

   The member template class rebind provides a way to obtain an allocator for a
   different type. For example, std::list<T, A> allocates nodes of some internal type
   Node<T>, using the allocator
   A::rebind<Node<T>>::other
   \fI(until C++11)\fP
   std::allocator_traits<A>::rebind_alloc<Node<T>>, which is implemented in terms of
   A::rebind<Node<T>>::other if A is an std::allocator
   \fI(since C++11)\fP.

   Member type is_always_equal is deprecated via LWG issue 3170, because it makes
   custom allocators derived from std::allocator treated as always equal by default.
   std::allocator_traits<std::allocator<T>>::is_always_equal is not deprecated and its
   member constant value is true for any T.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <memory>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <string>

 int main()
 {
     {
         // default allocator for ints
         std::allocator<int> alloc;

         // demonstrating the few directly usable members
         static_assert(std::is_same_v<int, decltype(alloc)::value_type>);
         int* p = alloc.allocate(1);  // space for one int
         alloc.deallocate(p, 1);      // and it is gone

         // Even those can be used through traits though, so no need
         using traits_t = std::allocator_traits<decltype(alloc)>; // The matching trait
         p = traits_t::allocate(alloc, 1);
         traits_t::construct(alloc, p, 7);       // construct the int
         std::cout << *p << '\\n';
         traits_t::deallocate(alloc, p, 1);      // deallocate space for one int
     }

     {
         // default allocator for strings
         std::allocator<std::string> alloc;
         // matching traits
         using traits_t = std::allocator_traits<decltype(alloc)>;

         // Rebinding the allocator using the trait for strings gets the same type
         traits_t::rebind_alloc<std::string> alloc_ = alloc;

         std::string* p = traits_t::allocate(alloc, 2); // space for 2 strings

         traits_t::construct(alloc, p, "foo");
         traits_t::construct(alloc, p + 1, "bar");

         std::cout << p[0] << ' ' << p[1] << '\\n';

         traits_t::destroy(alloc, p + 1);
         traits_t::destroy(alloc, p);
         traits_t::deallocate(alloc, p, 2);
     }
 }
