.SH Synopsis
   iterator erase( iterator pos );                          \fI(since C++11)\fP
   iterator erase( const_iterator pos );                    \fI(since C++11)\fP
   iterator erase( const_iterator first,                                  \fI(since C++11)\fP
   const_iterator last );                           \fB(1)\fP
   size_type erase( const Key& key );                   \fB(2)\fP \fB(3)\fP           \fI(since C++11)\fP
   template< class K >                                      \fB(4)\fP           (since C++23)
   size_type erase( K&& x );

   Removes specified elements from the container.

   1) Removes the element at pos.
   2) Removes the elements in the range [first; last), which must be a valid range in
   *this.
   3) Removes all elements with the key equivalent to key.
   4) Removes all elements with key that compares equivalent to the value x. This
   overload participates in overload resolution only if Hash::is_transparent and
   KeyEqual::is_transparent are valid and each denotes a type, and neither iterator nor
   const_iterator is implicitly convertible from K. This assumes that such Hash is
   callable with both K and Key type, and that the KeyEqual is transparent, which,
   together, allows calling this function without constructing an instance of Key.

   References and iterators to the erased elements are invalidated. Other iterators and
   references are not invalidated.

   The iterator pos must be valid and dereferenceable. Thus the end() iterator (which
   is valid, but is not dereferenceable) cannot be used as a value for pos.

   The order of the elements that are not erased is preserved. (This makes it possible
   to erase individual elements while iterating through the container.)

.SH Parameters

   pos         - iterator to the element to remove
   first, last - range of elements to remove
   key         - key value of the elements to remove
   x           - a value of any type that can be transparently compared with a key
                 denoting the elements to remove

.SH Return value

   1-2) Iterator following the last removed element.
   3,4) Number of elements removed.

.SH Exceptions

   1,2) Throws nothing.
   3,4) Any exceptions thrown by the Hash and KeyEqual object.

.SH Complexity

   Given an instance c of unordered_multimap:

   1) Average case: constant, worst case: c.size()
   2) Average case: std::distance(first, last), worst case: c.size()
   3) Average case: c.count(key), worst case: c.size()
   4) Average case: c.count(x), worst case: c.size()

.SH Notes

   Feature-test macro: __cpp_lib_associative_heterogeneous_erasure (for overload \fB(4)\fP)

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <unordered_map>
 #include <iostream>
 int main()
 {
     std::unordered_multimap<int, std::string> c = {
         {1, "one" }, {2, "two" }, {3, "three"},
         {4, "four"}, {5, "five"}, {6, "six"  }
     };

     // erase all odd numbers from c
     for(auto it = c.begin(); it != c.end(); ) {
         if(it->first % 2 != 0)
             it = c.erase(it);
         else
             ++it;
     }

     for(auto& p : c) {
         std::cout << p.second << ' ';
     }
 }

.SH Possible output:
