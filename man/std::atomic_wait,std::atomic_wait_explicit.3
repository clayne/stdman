   void atomic_wait_explicit( const volatile
   std::atomic<T>* object,
   typename std::atomic<T>::value_type old,

   std::memory_order order );

   Performs atomic waiting operations. Behaves as if it repeatedly performs the
   following steps:

     * Compare the value representation of object->load(std::memory_order_seq_cst) or
       object->load(order) with that of old.

          * If those are bitwise equal, then blocks until *object is notified by
            std::atomic::notify_one() or std::atomic::notify_all(), or the thread is
            unblocked spuriously.
          * Otherwise, returns.

   These functions are guaranteed to return only if value has changed, even if
   underlying implementation unblocks spuriously.

   1) Equivalent to object->wait(old, std::memory_order_seq_cst).
   2) Equivalent to object->wait(old, order).

.SH Parameters

   object - pointer to the atomic object to check and wait on
   old    - the value to check the atomic object no longer contains
   order  - the memory synchronization ordering for this operation: must not be
            std::memory_order::release or std::memory_order::acq_rel

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Notes

   This form of change-detection is often more efficient than simple polling or pure
   spinlocks.

   Due to the ABA problem, transient changes from old to another value and back to old
   might be missed, and not unblock.

   The comparison is bitwise (similar to std::memcmp); no comparison operator is used.
   Padding bits that never participate in an object's value representation are ignored.
