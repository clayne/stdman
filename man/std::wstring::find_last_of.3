   Finds the last character equal to one of characters in the given character sequence.
   The exact search algorithm is not specified. The search considers only the interval
   [0, pos]. If the character is not present in the interval, npos will be returned.

   1) Finds the last character equal to one of characters in str.
   2) Finds the last character equal to one of characters in range [s, s+count). This
   range can include null characters.
   3) Finds the last character equal to one of characters in character string pointed
   to by s. The length of the string is determined by the first null character using
   Traits::length(s).
   4) Finds the last character equal to ch.
   5) Implicitly converts t to a string view sv as if by std::basic_string_view<CharT,
   Traits> sv = t;, then finds the last character equal to one of characters in sv.
   This overload participates in overload resolution only if
   std::is_convertible_v<const StringViewLike&, std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits>>
   is true and std::is_convertible_v<const StringViewLike&, const CharT*> is false.

   In all cases, equality is checked by calling Traits::eq.

.SH Parameters

   str   - string identifying characters to search for
   pos   - position at which the search is to finish
   count - length of character string identifying characters to search for
   s     - pointer to a character string identifying characters to search for
   ch    - character to search for
   t     - object (convertible to std::basic_string_view) identifying characters to
           search for

.SH Return value

   Position of the found character or npos if no such character is found.

.SH Exceptions

   5)
   noexcept specification:
   noexcept(std::is_nothrow_convertible_v<const T&, std::basic_string_view<CharT,
   Traits>>)

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include<string>
 #include<iostream>
 int main()
 {
     const std::string path="/root/config";
     auto const pos=path.find_last_of('/');
     const auto leaf=path.substr(pos+1);

     std::cout << leaf << '\\n';
 }
