   Call signature
   template< ranges::viewable_range R, class Pred >

   requires /* see below */                                               \fI(since C++20)\fP

   constexpr ranges::view auto take_while( R&& r, Pred&& pred );
   template< class Pred >                                                 \fI(since C++20)\fP
   constexpr /*range adaptor closure*/ take_while( Pred&& pred );

   1) A range adaptor that represents view of the elements from an underlying sequence,
   starting at the beginning and ending at the first element for which the predicate
   returns false.
   2) Range adaptor object. The expression views::take_while(e, f) is
   expression-equivalent to take_while_view(e, f) for any suitable subexpressions e and
   f.

   take_while_view models the concepts contiguous_range, random_access_range,
   bidirectional_range, forward_range, and input_range when the underlying view V
   models respective concepts.

  Expression-equivalent

   Expression e is expression-equivalent to expression f, if

     * e and f have the same effects, and
     * either both are constant subexpressions or else neither is a constant
       subexpression, and
     * either both are potentially-throwing or else neither is potentially-throwing
       (i.e. noexcept(e) == noexcept(f)).

.SH Member functions

   constructor   constructs a take_while_view
   (C++20)       \fI(public member function)\fP

   data          Gets the address of derived view's data. Provided if its iterator type
   (C++20)       satisfies contiguous_iterator.

   front         Returns the first element in the derived view. Provided if it
   (C++20)       satisfies forward_range.
                 \fI(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)\fP
   operator[]    Returns the nth element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies
   (C++20)       random_access_range.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <ranges>
 #include <iostream>

 int main()
 {
     for (int year : std::views::iota(2017)
                   | std::views::take_while([](int y) { return y <= 2020; })) {
         std::cout << year << ' ';
     }
     std::cout << '\\n';

     const char idea[] {"Today is yesterday's tomorrow!.."};
     for (char x : std::ranges::take_while_view(idea, [](char c) { return c != '.'; })) {
         std::cout << x;
     }
     std::cout << '\\n';
 }
