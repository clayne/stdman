.SH NAME
std::counting_semaphore::try_acquire_for \- std::counting_semaphore::try_acquire_for

.SH Synopsis
   template<class Rep, class Period>
   bool try_acquire_for( const std::chrono::duration<Rep, Period>&        \fI(since C++20)\fP
   rel_time );

   Tries to atomically decrement the internal counter by 1 if it is greater than
   0; otherwise blocks until it is greater than 0 and can successfully
   decrement the internal counter, or the rel_time duration has been exceeded.

.SH Preconditions

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Parameters

   rel_time - the minimum duration the function must wait for to fail

.SH Return value

   true if it decremented the internal counter, otherwise false

.SH Exceptions

   May throw std::system_error or a timeout-related exception.

.SH Notes

   In practice the function may take longer than rel_time to fail.

   Implementations are allowed to fail to decrement the counter even if it was greater
   than 0 - i.e., they are allowed to spuriously fail and return false.
