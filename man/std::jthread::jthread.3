   jthread() noexcept;                               \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP
   jthread( jthread&& other ) noexcept;              \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP

   explicit jthread( Function&& f, Args&&... args );
   jthread( const jthread& ) = delete;               \fB(4)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Constructs new jthread object.

   1) Creates new jthread object which does not represent a thread.
   2) Move constructor. Constructs the jthread object to represent the thread of
   execution that was represented by other. After this call other no longer represents
   a thread of execution.
   3) Creates new jthread object and associates it with a thread of execution. The new
   thread of execution starts executing

     * std::invoke(std::move(f_copy), get_stop_token(), std::move(args_copy)...), if
       the expression is valid; otherwise, it starts executing
     * std::invoke(std::move(f_copy), std::move(args_copy)...).

   In either case,

     * f_copy is an object of type std::decay_t<Function> and constructed from
       std::forward<Function>(f), and
     * args_copy... are objects of types std::decay_t<Args>... and constructed from
       std::forward<Args>(args)....

   Constructions of these objects are executed in the context of the caller, so that
   any exceptions thrown during evaluation and copying/moving of the arguments are
   thrown in the current thread, without starting the new thread. The program is
   ill-formed if any construction or the std::invoke call is invalid.
   This constructor does not participate in overload resolution if
   std::remove_cvref_t<Function> is the same type as jthread.
   The completion of the invocation of the constructor synchronizes-with (as defined in
   std::memory_order) the beginning of the invocation of the copy of f on the new
   thread of execution.
   4) The copy constructor is deleted; threads are not copyable. No two std::jthread
   objects may represent the same thread of execution.

.SH Parameters

   other   - another jthread object to construct this jthread object with
   f       - Callable object to execute in the new thread
   args... - arguments to pass to the new function

.SH Postconditions

   1) get_id() equal to std::jthread::id() (i.e. joinable() returns false) and
   get_stop_source().stop_possible() is false.
   2) other.get_id() equal to std::jthread::id() and get_id() returns the value of
   other.get_id() prior to the start of construction.
   3) get_id() not equal to std::jthread::id() (i.e. joinable() returns true), and
   get_stop_source().stop_possible() is true.

.SH Exceptions

   3) std::system_error if the thread could not be started. The exception may represent
   the error condition std::errc::resource_unavailable_try_again or another
   implementation-specific error condition.

.SH Notes

   The arguments to the thread function are moved or copied by value. If a reference
   argument needs to be passed to the thread function, it has to be wrapped (e.g. with
   std::ref or std::cref).

   Any return value from the function is ignored. If the function throws an exception,
   std::terminate is called. In order to pass return values or exceptions back to the
   calling thread, std::promise or std::async may be used.
