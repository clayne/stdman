   std::basic_stringbuf is a std::basic_streambuf whose associated character sequence
   is a memory-resident sequence of arbitrary characters, which can be initialized from
   or made available as an instance of std::basic_string.

   Typical implementations of std::basic_stringbuf hold an object of type
   std::basic_string or equivalent resizeable sequence container directly as a data
   member and use it as both the controlled character sequence (the array where the six
   pointers of std::basic_streambuf are pointing to) and as the associated character
   sequence (the source of characters for all input operations and the target for the
   output).

   In addition, a typical implementation holds a data member of type
   std::ios_base::openmode to indicate the status of the stream (input-only,
   output-only, input/output, at-end, etc).

   if over-allocation strategy is used by overflow(), an additional
   high-watermark pointer may be stored to track the last initialized     \fI(since C++11)\fP
   character.

   Two specializations for common character types are also defined:
