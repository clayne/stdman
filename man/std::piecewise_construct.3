.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <utility>
   struct piecewise_construct_t { explicit piecewise_construct_t() =      \fI(since C++11)\fP
   default; };
   constexpr std::piecewise_construct_t piecewise_construct{};            \fI(since C++11)\fP
                                                                          \fI(until C++17)\fP
   inline constexpr std::piecewise_construct_t piecewise_construct{};     \fI(since C++17)\fP

   std::piecewise_construct_t is an empty class tag type used to disambiguate between
   different functions that take two tuple arguments. The constant
   std::piecewise_construct is an instance of it.

   The overloads that do not use std::piecewise_construct_t assume that each tuple
   argument becomes the element of a pair. The overloads that use
   std::piecewise_construct_t assume that each tuple argument is used to construct,
   piecewise, a new object of specified type, which will become the element of the
   pair.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <utility>
 #include <tuple>

 struct Foo {
     Foo(std::tuple<int, float>)
     {
         std::cout << "Constructed a Foo from a tuple\\n";
     }
     Foo(int, float)
     {
         std::cout << "Constructed a Foo from an int and a float\\n";
     }
 };

 int main()
 {
     std::tuple<int, float> t(1, 3.14);
     std::pair<Foo, Foo> p1(t, t);
     std::pair<Foo, Foo> p2(std::piecewise_construct, t, t);
 }

.SH Output:

 Constructed a Foo from a tuple
 Constructed a Foo from a tuple
 Constructed a Foo from an int and a float
 Constructed a Foo from an int and a float

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to
   previously published C++ standards.

   LWG 2510 C++11      the default constructor was non-explicit, which made explicit
                       could lead to ambiguity
