.SH NAME
std::ostreambuf_iterator::ostreambuf_iterator \- std::ostreambuf_iterator::ostreambuf_iterator

.SH Synopsis
   ostreambuf_iterator( streambuf_type* buffer )            \fI(until C++11)\fP
   throw();
   ostreambuf_iterator( streambuf_type* buffer )            \fI(since C++11)\fP
   noexcept;                                        \fB(1)\fP
   ostreambuf_iterator( ostream_type& stream )                            \fI(until C++11)\fP
   throw();                                             \fB(2)\fP
   ostreambuf_iterator( ostream_type& stream )                            \fI(since C++11)\fP
   noexcept;

   1) Constructs the iterator with the private streambuf_type* member set to buffer and
   the failed() flag set to false. The behavior is undefined if buffer is a null
   pointer.
   2) Same as ostreambuf_iterator(stream.rdbuf()).

.SH Parameters

   stream - the output stream whose rdbuf() will be accessed by this iterator
   buffer - the output stream buffer to be accessed by this iterator

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <fstream>
 #include <iterator>
 int main()
 {
     std::basic_filebuf<char> f;
     f.open("test.txt", std::ios::out);

     std::ostreambuf_iterator<char> out1(&f);

     std::ostreambuf_iterator<wchar_t> out2(std::wcout);

     *out1 = 'a';
     *out2 = L'a';
 }
