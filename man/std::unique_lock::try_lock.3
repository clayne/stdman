.SH NAME
std::unique_lock::try_lock \- std::unique_lock::try_lock

.SH Synopsis
   bool try_lock();  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Tries to lock (i.e., takes ownership of) the associated mutex without blocking.
   Effectively calls mutex()->try_lock().

   std::system_error is thrown if there is no associated mutex or if the mutex is
   already locked by this std::unique_lock.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   true if the ownership of the mutex has been acquired successfully, false otherwise.

.SH Exceptions

     * Any exceptions thrown by mutex()->try_lock() (Mutex types do not throw in
       try_lock, but a custom Lockable might)

     * If there is no associated mutex, std::system_error with an error code of
       std::errc::operation_not_permitted

     * If the mutex is already locked by this std::unique_lock, std::system_error with
       an error code of std::errc::resource_deadlock_would_occur

.SH Example

   The following examples try to acquire a mutex that was locked and unlocked.


// Run this code

 #include <mutex>
 #include <thread>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <vector>
 #include <chrono>

 int main()
 {
     std::mutex counter_mutex;
     std::vector<std::thread> threads;

     auto worker_task = [&](int id, int wait_seconds, int acquire_seconds) {
         // wait for a few seconds before acquiring lock.
         std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(wait_seconds));

         std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(counter_mutex, std::defer_lock);
         if (lock.try_lock()) {
             std::cout << id << ", lock acquired.\\n";
         } else {
             std::cout << id << ", failed acquiring lock.\\n";
             return;
         }

         // keep the lock for a while.
         std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(acquire_seconds));

         std::cout << id << ", releasing lock.\\n";
         lock.unlock();
     };

     threads.emplace_back(worker_task, 0, 0, 2);
     threads.emplace_back(worker_task, 1, 1, 0);
     threads.emplace_back(worker_task, 2, 3, 0);

     for (auto &thread : threads) thread.join();
 }

.SH Output:

 0, lock acquired.
 1, failed acquiring lock.
 0, releasing lock.
 2, lock acquired.
 2, releasing lock.
