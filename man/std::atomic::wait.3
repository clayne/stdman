.SH NAME
std::atomic::wait \- std::atomic::wait

.SH Synopsis
   void wait( T old,
   std::memory_order order = std::memory_order::seq_cst ) const
   noexcept;                                                             \fI(since C++20)\fP
   void wait( T old,
   std::memory_order order = std::memory_order::seq_cst ) const
   volatile noexcept;

   Performs atomic waiting operations. Behaves as if it repeatedly performs the
   following steps:

     * Compare the value representation of this->load(order) with that of old.

          * If those are equal, then blocks until *this is notified by notify_one() or
            notify_all(), or the thread is unblocked spuriously.
          * Otherwise, returns.

   These functions are guaranteed to return only if value has changed, even if
   underlying implementation unblocks spuriously.

.SH Parameters

   old   - the value to check the atomic's object no longer contains
   order - the memory synchronization ordering for this operation: must not be
           std::memory_order::release or std::memory_order::acq_rel

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Notes

   This form of change-detection is often more efficient than simple polling or pure
   spinlocks.

   Due to the ABA problem, transient changes from old to another value and back to old
   might be missed, and not unblock.

   The comparison is bitwise (similar to std::memcmp); no comparison operator is used.
   Padding bits that never participate in an object's value representation are ignored.
