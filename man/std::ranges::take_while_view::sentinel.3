.SH Synopsis
   template<bool Const>                    \fI(since C++20)\fP
   class /*sentinel*/; // exposition only

   The return type of take_while_view::end.

   The type /*sentinel*/<true> is returned by the const-qualified overload. The type
   /*sentinel*/<false> is returned by the non-const-qualified overload.

   The name of this class template (shown here as sentinel) is unspecified.

   Typical implementation holds two data members: a sentinel that represents the end of
   the underlying view, and a pointer to the predicate.
