.SH NAME
std::ranges::viewable_range \- std::ranges::viewable_range

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <ranges>
   template<class T>

   concept viewable_range =
   ranges::range<T> &&
   ((ranges::view<std::remove_cvref_t<T>> &&
   std::constructible_from<std::remove_cvref_t<T>, T>) ||                 \fI(since C++20)\fP
   (!ranges::view<std::remove_cvref_t<T>> &&
   (std::is_lvalue_reference_v<T> ||

   (std::movable<std::remove_reference_t<T>> &&
   !/*is-initializer-list*/<T>))));

   The viewable_range concept is a refinement of range that describes a range that can
   be safely converted into a view.

   The constant /*is-initializer-list*/<T> is true if and only if
   std::remove_cvref_t<T> is a specialization of std::initializer_list.
