.SH NAME
std::to_string \- std::to_string

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <stacktrace>
   template< class Allocator >                                           (since C++23)
   std::string to_string( const std::basic_stacktrace<Allocator>& st );

   Returns a string with a description of st.

   The description of a basic_stacktrace typically contains description of its entries,
   although the number of lines is not required to be equal to size().

.SH Parameters

   st - a basic_stacktrace whose description is to be returned

.SH Return value

   A string with a description of st.

.SH Exceptions

   May throw implementation-defined exceptions.

.SH Notes

   Custom allocators support for this function is not provided, because the
   implementations usually require platform specific allocations, system calls and a
   lot of CPU intensive work, while a custom allocator does not provide benefits for
   this function as the platform specific operations take an order of magnitude more
   time than the allocation.

.SH Example


// Run this code

 #include <stacktrace>
 #include <string>
 #include <iostream>

 int main()
 {
     auto trace = std::stacktrace::current();
     std::cout << std::to_string(trace) << '\\n';
 }

.SH Possible output:

  0# 0x0000000000402D97 in ./prog.exe
  1# __libc_start_main in /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6
  2# 0x0000000000402CA9 in ./prog.exe
